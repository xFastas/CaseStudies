Case Studies 2024 Repository

**Overview**

This repository contains all documents and scripts developed by Team Texas during the 2024 Case Studies course at Towson University.


**Course Description**

Case Studies was a live, 24-hour cyber security course at Towson University designed to simulate real-world IT and security challenges. Students were divided into teams of four, each assuming the role of an IT/Security specialist team for a fictional corporation named after an American state. The premise involved taking over for the IT team that had been terminated due to poor performance, leaving the new teams responsible for securing and maintaining the network infrastructure.


**Team Responsibilities**

At the start, each team was assigned eight systems, each running multiple services. Over time, this grew to encompass 35 systems, spanning various distributions of Linux and Windows, with a total of 174 services being monitored 24/7. The teams were tasked with maintaining the uptime of these services, which were continuously monitored and scored based on their operational stability.

Throughout the course, teams were required to:

- Complete Corporate Tickets: These tasks included configuring new systems and services, addressing security vulnerabilities, and responding to various IT challenges.

- Defend Against Attacks: Teams were responsible for protecting their network from both classmates and a professional Red Team of hackers, who aimed to compromise the network with different attack strategies.

- Manage Resources: Points earned from maintaining service uptime were stored in a team-specific bank and could be used to purchase up to 15 flags. The first team to secure all 15 flags earned an automatic A grade and the victory.


**Course Structure**

The semester was divided into three episodes, each requiring the completion of:

- Offensive Operations: Teams conducted cyber-attacks on competing teams, requiring both a plan of attack and an after action report to be uploaded to a shared folder (that could be attacked by other teams).

- Incident Response: Teams managed and resolved security incidents within their networks, requiring at least one report to be completed each episode.

- Executive Reports/Briefings: These reports provided an overview of the network's status, summarizing the team's activities and challenges during the episode. The final report for Episode 3 also included a comprehensive Risk Assessment of the entire network.

At the conclusion of each episode, teams presented a briefing to individuals representing the company's CEO, detailing their performance and strategic decisions.


**Repository Contents**

The repository is organized into sections, with the Reports section housing the executive reports, incident responses, and risk assessments. Additional documents and scripts developed throughout the course are also included, showcasing the work and strategies employed by Team Texas.
